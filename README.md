# singly_linked_list
<br>  

## This is a simple singly linked list exercise
It has three classes, the Node, Team and TournamentEntry classes. 
Each class has certain attributes, for example the Team class has attributes:
1. teamName (String)
2. teamNumber (int)
3. regYear(long)
4. firstScore (int)
5. secondScore (int)

for this project we don't make use of setters and getters, these are for upcoming projects which are advanced.
This features a simple linked list which has Teams as Nodes. We may sort the linked list by certain features, such as register year (regYear), final scores (finalScore) and alphabetical order.

### for sample input you may make use of these values:

#### Choose the number of teams to add as 4.  
#### (Now copy and paste these values line by line)  
Able 8 2001 48 55  
dragon 9 2005 80 70  
Chelsea 6 1978 88 95  
Able 5 1999 48 55  

### if you choose the sorting feature as finalScore, you should have the following output:  
Chelsea 6 1978 88 95 91.5  
Dragon 9 2005 80 70 75  
Able 5 1999 48 55. 51.5  
Able 8 2001 48 55. 51.5
